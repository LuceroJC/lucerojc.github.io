This Bible, also known as the Adulterous Bible or the Sinners' Bible, is a 1631 edition of the King James Bible. It has a mistake in the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20,14, where it reads "Thou shalt commit adultery" (i.e., the word "not" is missing). Most of the copies were destroyed, except for a few ones that nowadays are highly valuable by collectors. See below a zoom of the "wicked" Commandments.
