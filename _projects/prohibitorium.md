The Index Librorum Prohibitorum is a list of texts, authors and publishers prohibited by the Catholic Church. The first index was published in 1557 under command of Pope Paul IV, but was soon withdrawn. After a second version published in 1559, the Council of Trent revised and authorized the so-called Tridentine index, promulgated in 1564.  From 1571, the index was regularly updated by the Sacred Congregation of the Index, until the last edition published in 1948. It was finally abolished in 1966.

Above is the cover of the Index printed in Rome in 1564. The original is from the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze (via Internet Archive). The illustration with the anchor and the dolphin represents the Latin adage festina lente (“make haste slowly”). The image was adopted as a trademark by the Italian typographer Aldo Manuzio (creator of the italic type, among other things) for his Aldina Press, founded in 1494 in Venice, and later publisher of the Index shown here.
