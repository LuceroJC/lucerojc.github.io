This is the Bible for the Church of England published in 1611 at the commission of King James VI and I. Including its later editions, it is the most published book in history. My reconstruction uses Fredrick Brennanâ€™s KJV 1611 Gothic font, which reproduces the original font of the printed version. It is a beautiful book, and I wish that I had the time and resources to reconstruct it in its entirety.
