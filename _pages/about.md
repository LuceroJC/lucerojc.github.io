I am interested in most applications of math and computing to __voice and speech production__ studies. The vocal folds at the larynx constitute a biomechanical oscillator that acts as a sound source in phonation. Under proper conditions, the air flow through the glottis induces their oscillation. The oscillation, in turn, modulates the airflow, which results in the generation of an acoustical wave. This mechanism of sound production in common to most mammals, and to songbirds by action of their syrinx's membranes. Speech is then the result of the combination of phonation with articulation. In my work, I use mathematical and computational models of this system to characterize its physical principles, and contribute to the development of engineering tools for analysis, clinical diagnosis and treatment. Specific research topics have included: dynamics of the vocal fold oscillation, [physics-based synthesis of vocal timbre](/simuvox/), analysis of aerodynamic and articulatory patterns of speech, acoustic analysis of voice, and muscle-based 3D animation of speech facial movements.

Also, I have worked on modeling problems in [epidemiology](/covid/), formal language theory, geometric folding operations, and other areas. See my [publications](/publications/) for details.
