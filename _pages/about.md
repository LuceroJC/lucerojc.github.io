I am interested in applying mathematics and computing to further our understanding of __voice and speech production__. The vocal folds in the larynx act as a biomechanical oscillator that generates sound during phonation. Under the right conditions, airflow through the glottis causes the vocal folds to oscillate, which in turn modulates the airflow and produces an acoustic wave. This sound production mechanism is common across mammals and songbirds. Speech then arises from combining phonation with articulation. In my research, I use mathematical and computational models of this system to uncover the fundamental physical principles and develop engineering tools for analysis, diagnosis, and treatment in clinical settings. My projects have included modeling vocal fold oscillation dynamics, [physics-based synthesis of vocal timbre](/simuvox), analyzing aerodynamic and articulatory patterns in speech, acoustic analysis of voice, and 3D muscle-based animation of speech facial movements.

I recently launched a blog entitled [One Fold at a Time](https://onefoldatatime.com/), where I explore the intersections of origami, engineering, and design. Readers interested in paper folding arts, mathematics, and the creative possibilities of origami are encouraged to visit it.
